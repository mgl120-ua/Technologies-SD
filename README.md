# Technologies-SD - Vinyl Web
## Objectives 
ViniloWeb is a platform that aims to bring music in vinyl format to everyone and especially focus on those interested in this type of items so they can explore and acquire in a physical way vinyl records of their favorite artists. The platform will allow users to browse vinyl record collections, search for their favorite artists and albums, and filter through different genres. We are committed to developing a high-quality, easy-to-use platform that provides an exceptional user experience. As new features we intend to add the possibility for users to rate and comment their purchased vinyls for future customers.

## Description 
Administration
The administration application will allow platform administrators to perform the following managements:

● User management: manage existing users in the application.

● Order management: Manage the orders placed by the different users in the application.

Employee Portal

Public Web.

● Consultation of the list of products.

● Consultation of previous purchases.

● Consultation of products on offer.

● Consultation of reviews of the buyers of the articles.

● Purchase of products “added to cart”.

## Target audience 
The website is intended for the general public, so it should be easy to use and should avoid overly technical language. It should also be modern to try to appeal to a younger audience, while understandable a more adult audience. The sale of vinyl is something that is conspicuous by its absence nowadays, as digital content is used much more. As there are not many places where this type of products are sold, by doing it online (website/application), people in general will be more likely to buy them, even older people who are not so tech savvy. That's why the implementation is designed to be simple, easy to understand and very clear.
